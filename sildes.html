        <h2>THe Difficulty With Math</h2>
<p>
<br>
    </p>
<ul>
<li>There is a dense language surrounding math so a single search for a term can lead to many follow up searches (ex: functor &amp; homomorphism)<br>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Many symbols defy a simple google search&nbsp; âŠ•</li>
<li>The application of what you're reading to CS is often unstated and unclear.</li>
<li>I can't fix that for all of math, but I can try to elucidate this for monoids.<br>
</li>
</ul>
